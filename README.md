# Kickstarting with Excel
## *Overview*: We will be using a dataset of more than 4,000 campaigns conducted over the last decade to analyze their success rate (and sometimes lack thereof) and compare against Launch Dates and Funding Goals.
### *Purpose*: Client Louise has started conducting a fundraising campaign for a play (Fever), and she would like to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.
### *Analysis and Challenges*: We were able to hone in on data specifically relating to theater and even more specifically, relating to plays (as opposed to musicals or theater spaces). The data presented a challenge given the original "Category," but we were able to break out a Subcategory that allowed for more pertinent data to be studied. From here, we could analyze "successful" campaigns based on the month of the year (regardless of year) (See Figure A below) as well as the percentage of successful campaigns between certain dollar goals (See Figure B below).

### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date*: 
### *Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals*: 
## *Results*: As seen from Figure A, May is the most successful month during which to launch a campaign while the rest of the summer is also fairly successful in relation to other times of year. The other months of the year see a fairly consistent trend between successful and failed campaigns, meaning they spike and decline at a comparable rate. As seen from Figure B, campaigns are generally more successful if their goals are smaller. You can see three quarters of the campaigns under $1,000 were sucessful, steadly declining as you increase the goal to $30,000. Interestingly, there's an uptick in success from $30,000 to $45,000 because a large decline (although there were very few plays in the data with funding goals between $40,000 to $50,000 so that data doesn't hold as much clout.

May or June are the most successful months to launch campaigns in general and specifically for plays. Setting a goal of $3k-$5k is realistic as the trends show more failed campaigns once you attempt to obtain more than $5k and upwards of $10k.
